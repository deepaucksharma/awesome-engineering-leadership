# GitHub Pages Deployment Verification

## 🚀 Current Setup Status

### ✅ What's Been Configured

1. **Unified Deployment Workflow**: `deploy-site.yml`
   - Builds both static content and Next.js app
   - Deploys everything to GitHub Pages in one workflow
   - Triggered on every push to main branch

2. **System Design Mastery Setup**:
   - ✅ package-lock.json committed (required for npm ci)
   - ✅ Next.js configured with correct base path
   - ✅ All source files in place
   - ✅ Build process configured

3. **Deployment Structure**:
   ```
   GitHub Pages Root/
   ├── index.html (main landing page)
   ├── Outcome-Driven-Leadership/
   ├── Insight-driven-decision-making/
   ├── adaptive-leadership-in-tech/
   └── system-design-mastery/
       └── [Next.js app files]
   ```

## 🔍 How to Verify Deployment

### 1. Check GitHub Actions
Visit: https://github.com/deepaucksharma/awesome-engineering-leadership/actions

Look for the **"Deploy Complete Site"** workflow. It should show:
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Currently running
- ✅ Green check = Successfully deployed
- ❌ Red X = Failed (check logs)

### 2. Monitor Build Progress
The workflow has these steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js
3. Create site structure
4. Install npm dependencies
5. Build Next.js app
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

### 3. Expected Timeline
- Build process: 2-3 minutes
- GitHub Pages activation: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: ~5 minutes**

## 🌐 Access Your Sites

Once deployed, you can access:

### Main Landing Page
https://deepaucksharma.github.io/awesome-engineering-leadership/

### System Design Mastery (Full App)
https://deepaucksharma.github.io/awesome-engineering-leadership/system-design-mastery/

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check the Actions logs** for specific errors
2. **Common issues**:
   - Missing dependencies in package.json
   - Build errors in TypeScript/React code
   - Path configuration issues

3. **To test locally first**:
   ```bash
   cd system-design-mastery
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

### If site shows 404:

1. Wait a few more minutes (first deployment can be slow)
2. Check GitHub Pages settings: https://github.com/deepaucksharma/awesome-engineering-leadership/settings/pages
3. Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"

## 📊 What You'll See When It Works

The System Design Mastery app will show:
- Interactive 3D network visualization on homepage
- Fundamentals section with physics lessons
- Working latency calculator
- Speed of light demonstration
- System design playground (drag-and-drop)

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once deployed:
1. Test all interactive features
2. Share the link with your team
3. Continue adding more lessons and simulations
4. Monitor usage with GitHub Pages analytics
