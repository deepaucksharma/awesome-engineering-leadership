# GitHub Pages Deployment Status

## 🚀 Deployment Information

Your Engineering Leadership resources are being deployed to GitHub Pages!

### 📋 Check Deployment Status

1. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/deepaucksharma/awesome-engineering-leadership/actions
   - Look for the "Deploy Static Site to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Green checkmark = Successfully deployed

2. **GitHub Pages Settings**: https://github.com/deepaucksharma/awesome-engineering-leadership/settings/pages
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - You'll see the live URL here once deployed

### 🌐 Access Your Sites

Once deployed (usually takes 2-5 minutes), your sites will be available at:

- **Main Site**: https://deepaucksharma.github.io/awesome-engineering-leadership/
- **System Design Course**: https://deepaucksharma.github.io/awesome-engineering-leadership/system-design-mastery/

### 📊 Current Status

The deployment includes:
- ✅ Static HTML landing pages
- ✅ Links to all leadership frameworks
- ✅ System Design Mastery placeholder page
- 🚧 Full Next.js application (requires additional setup)

### 🔧 Next Steps for Full Next.js Deployment

To get the interactive System Design course fully working:

1. **Install dependencies locally**:
   ```bash
   cd system-design-mastery
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Deploy Next.js app** (after local testing):
   - Update the `deploy-system-design.yml` workflow
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
   - Push changes to trigger deployment

### 🎯 What's Working Now

- Landing page with links to all resources
- Basic navigation structure
- Responsive design
- "Coming Soon" page for System Design Mastery

### 📝 Notes

- GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to activate on first deployment
- Clear your browser cache if you don't see updates
- The full interactive features require the Next.js build to complete
