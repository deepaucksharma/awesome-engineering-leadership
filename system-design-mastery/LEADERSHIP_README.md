# System Design Mastery - Interactive Learning Platform

## 📚 What is this?

This is a revolutionary system design course that teaches from **first principles** through **interactive simulations**, not lectures or slides. It's designed for engineering leaders and senior engineers who want to deeply understand system design, not just memorize patterns.

## 🎯 Why is this in Engineering Leadership?

Great engineering leaders need to:
- **Understand technical trade-offs** deeply to make informed decisions
- **Mentor engineers** on system design with clarity
- **Bridge the gap** between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation
- **Lead architectural discussions** with confidence

This course provides the foundation for technical leadership by building intuition from the ground up.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Deploy Your Own Instance

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## 📖 Course Structure

1. **The Physics of Computing** - Start with speed of light, build up to distributed systems
2. **Building Blocks** - Storage, networking, and compute from first principles
3. **Distributed Fundamentals** - Consensus, replication, and consistency
4. **Real System Case Studies** - WhatsApp, UPI, Hotstar deconstructed

## 🌟 Key Features

- **No Slides**: Everything is interactive
- **Real Numbers**: Actual measurements, not estimates
- **Learn by Breaking**: Intentionally cause failures to understand resilience
- **Visual Learning**: 3D visualizations and real-time simulations
